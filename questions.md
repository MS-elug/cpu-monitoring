- Scooring: Does the size of the codebase part of the scoring ? Should I target a very small application as possible or build a normal one?
- Does the number of project dependencies impacts the scoring ?

Design System:
 - Is it recommended to keep a similar look & field as Datadog?

Might be "too serious questions" for a take home project, feel free to answer if this is relevant:
- browser support: is it fine to supports only N-2 last versions for Firefox/Chrome/Edge ? (no IE in scope)
- device support: what is the main target for the app ? desktop, mobile or tablet ? If multiple device is targeted is it fine to do a simple responsive design ? 
- Should the backend accept external IPs or only local (loopback address)

TO take into account:
- The server implementation should have the less impact as possible on the CPU


Idea:
- alerting: update the task color / background color of the app / play sound / display notification
- Add log push to DataDog
